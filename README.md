# csm
An R package for Causal State Models

# The Proposal
An R package “csm” with a framework for using Causal State Models.

#Info
Causal State Models are equivalent of Hidden Markov Models with a property, that state transition probability and observation probability are united. They are the unique minimal sufficient statistics for a sequence of random variables Xt drawn from a discrete alphabet A.
CSSR (Causal-State Splitting Reconstruction) algorithm is the way to estimate Causal State Model from the data using statistical tests.
Here is a paper that describes algorithm and the theory in details

There are also an improvement, that gives algorithm ability to be even more automatic ( find the best values of some of the parameters for CSSR algorithm, described in the following paper.

Here is an extension that allows to determine the statistical significance level of the inferred model.

	By implementing all of these algorithms and techniques the framework will be able to find all the statistically significant patterns from discrete data time series with a minimal input and bias from a user.
