Description: This package provides tools for creation of Causal State Models -
    equivalent of Hidden Markov Models which are inferred from data using CSSR
    algorithm with a statistical test for (only chi-square is available at the
    moment). There is "csm" class and methods for it and CSSR algorithm
    implementation for inference of CSM from data.
